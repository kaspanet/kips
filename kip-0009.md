# Motivation
A few months back, the Kaspa network has faced a dust attack which exploited the high block-DAG capacity in order to increase the storage required for a full node (for a detailed account of this attack on Kaspa see [1]). A mempool patch [2] was applied to counter the attack by aggressively throttling transactions with more outputs than inputs. However, this patch did not properly address the quality-of-service (QoS) required for ordinary users making ordinary transactions, which often might contain excessive outputs (e.g. due to having a *change* output). Essentially, the patch harmed the scalability and throughput of the network by only allowing a single such transaction in each block. In this document we propose a comprehensive approach that balances the ostensibly contradictory objectives of preventing storage bloat without affecting the QoS.

Our proposal is based on a research paper written by authors of this document [3]. A draft of this paper with full analysis and proofs supporting the claims brought here exists but isn't published yet (as of writing this document). In this document we will focus on the concrete formula suggested and its practical implications.  

# Proposal
Blocks in the Kaspa block-DAG have a mass limit of 500,000. The mass of a block is the sum of the mass of all transactions it contains. In the current mass formula, different
types of data have different mass costs (for example, signatures have a relatively high mass per byte compared with other data since verifying them is computationally expansive).
Assume a transaction is composed (amongst other fields) from a set of input values $I$ and a set of output values $O$. We propose to add an additional mass component called the `storage_mass` computed in the following way: 
$$\text{storage mass}(tx) = \sum_{out.val  \in  O} \frac{C}{out.val} - \frac{C\cdot|I|^2}{\sum_{in.val \in I} in.val};$$ 
where $C$ is a constant controlling the correlation of inverse KAS value to mass units. 

A more concise representation of the same formula can be given using the harmonic and arithmetic means ($H, A$ respectively):
$$\text{storage mass}(tx) = C\left(\frac{|O|}{H(O)} - \frac{|I|}{A(I)}\right).$$

In essence, the formula is sensitive to the distribution of output values (penalizing smaller entries), while balancing this by taking into account the size and overall value of the input set. As proven in [3], the crucial meaning of this formula is that the overall `storage_mass` required for executing a set of transactions which results in $X$ growth of the UTXO-set, is now lower bounded by a quadratic expression in $X$. Assume $G$ is a DAG of transactions resulting in $growth(G)$ UTXO-set growth, and denote $budget(G)$ to be the overall value of UTXO entries consumed by $G$, then:
$$\text{storage mass}(G) \ge \frac{C\cdot growth^2(G)}{budget(G)}.$$

Below we will explain the meaning of this bound using concrete numbers.

## Combining storage mass with current mass formula
Using max operator and not sum since both quantities represent independent resources.

## Relaxed storage mass formula
The exception of 2:2 transactions. 

# Analysis of dust attack costs and regulation of UTXO set growth
- fixed budget
- fixed growth rate
- overall growth

# Quality of service and wallet consequences

## Ordinary wallet transactions

## Compounding transactions

## Exchanges and pools

## Micropayments
