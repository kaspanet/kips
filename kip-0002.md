# Motivation
DAGKNIGHT (DK) is a new consensus protocol, written by the authors of this KIP, that achieves responsiveness whilst being 50%-byzantine tolerant. It is therefore faster and more secure than GHOSTDAG (GD), which governes the current Kaspa network. In DK there’s no a priori hardcoded parameter k, and consequently it can adapt to the “real” k in the network. Concretely, in DK, clients or their wallets should incorporate k into their local confirmation policy of transactions (similarly to some clients requiring 6 confirmations in Bitcoin, and some 30 confirmations).

# Goals
* Complete the R&D work necessary to implement DK for Kaspa.
* **Implement DK on Kaspa as a consensus upgrade**.
* Add support and API for wallets' transaction acceptance policy, to correspond to DK's confirmation speed.

# Deliverables
* Applied research:
  - Adapt the consensus algorithm to enforce a global maximum bound on network latency (can be taken with a huge safety margin; does not affect confirmation times), which is necessary for difficulty and minting regulation, pruning, and more.
  - Devise efficient algorithms to implement the DK procedures — the current pseudocode is highly inefficient. The implementation will partially utilize the existing optimized GHOSTDAG codebase, as the latter is a subprocedure of DK.
  - Research the optimal bps in terms of confirmation times, and provide a recommendation. (optional)
* Implementation:
  - Implement DK on the Kaspa rust codebase as a consensus upgrade.
  - Design a transaction confirmation policy API and implement the supporting functionality in the node.
  - Documentation of consensus changes and API additions.

# Backwards compatibility
* Breaks consensus rules, requires hardfork
* Adds (and potentially breaks) RPC API
