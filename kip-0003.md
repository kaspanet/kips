# Abstract

This document specifies a scheme for implementing smart contracts on Kaspa.

# Motivation

Smart contracts would increase utility of Kaspa and make Kaspa worlds fastest smart contract-enabled network.

# Goals

* Making UTXOs stateful by a special storage place per UTXO.
* Implementing an isolated WASM runtime.
* **Implementing 2 new OPCODEs to KASScript which allows to deploy a smart contract or invoke a function of SC**.
* Allowing bundled wallet to interact w SCs via special commands.
Making UTXOs stateful and implementing 2 new OPCODEs to KASScript and needed VMs to node sofwares, supporting them on kaspawalletd by specific calls.

# Specification

In Kaspa, UTXOs stays forever(doesn't get affected by pruning) until it gets spent so will be good to use it for preventing much work for creating an immutable space.

* A new ``DEPLOY`` opcode will be implemented to KASScript which takes bytes of smart contract and constructor execution data as only parameter, this output can include Kaspa as value for payable constructors, when a new UTXO appears by that, it will be a smart contract.
* State of smart contract would be written to UTXO and also it will keep funds in it.
  - If deploying fails/reverts, this output will create new inputs which has same properties with execution UTXO inputs.

* For execution, a new `EXECUTE` opcode will be implemented to KASScript which has 2 parameters: one for specifying target smart contract and one for execution parameters.
  - When smart contract execution correctly happens, node will merge this output to smart contract UTXO and delete execution UTXO.
  - When smart contract creates an UTXO, input will be taken as smart contract and contract should use KASScript.
  - When smart contract invokes a SELFDESTRUCT-like operation, smart contract UTXO will be spent and sent to target wallet.
  - When smart contract execution is invalid/reverted, this output will create new inputs which has same properties with execution UTXO inputs.

# Backwards compatibility
No any problems because built top on Kaspa flexibility service aka KASScript.
