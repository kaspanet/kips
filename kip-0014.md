# Abstract
This KIP proposes the implementation of the Crescendo Hardfork for the Kaspa network, detailing the consensus changes and transition strategy for various components. The primary change in this KIP is the increase in Blocks Per Second (BPS) from 1 to 10, a significant adjustment with wide-ranging implications for node performance as well as storage and bandwidth requirements. This necessitates updates to many consensus parameters and, in some cases, a rethinking of existing mechanisms to ensure they remain efficient at the increased block rate (e.g., the sparse DAA window introduced in KIP-4).

Additionally, this hardfork includes the activation of other significant improvements to Kaspa. Starting with KIP-9, which introduces a critical mechanism for managing and mitigating state bloat, thereby regulating persistent storage requirements. This is complemented by KIP-13, which regulates transient storage requirements for a node. Another major component activated in this hardfork is KIP-10, which introduces new introspection opcodes to Kaspa's script engine. Through such introspection, these opcodes enable the concept of covenants, allowing for advanced transaction controls, including the design of additive addresses that support microtransactions and complement KIP-9.

This hardfork also marks the closure of KIP-1, the Kaspa Rust Rewrite. The performance improvements enabled by Rusty Kaspa (RK) provide the foundation necessary to support this upgrade, allowing the network to handle the increased demands of 10 BPS and beyond.

# Motivation
The Crescendo Hardfork is a proactive upgrade to the Kaspa network, made possible through RK. With TN11—a testnet operating at 10 BPS—running stably for over a year, the network has demonstrated its readiness for this transition. By increasing capacity and speed, this upgrade positions Kaspa to support anticipated demand from emerging technologies, including smart contract layers enabled via the ongoing based ZK bridge design [1].

# Specification
## Consensus changes
### 1. BPS-related changes

The following details the changes solely related to the bps increase.  

1. **Increasing BPS from 1 to 10**:
   - This change is governed by a consensus parameter named `target_time_per_block` (milliseconds), which controls the expected time between blocks. To increase bps from 1 to 10, the `target_time_per_block` will be reduced from 1000 ms to 100 ms.
   - This adjustment will in turn cause the difficulty adjustment algorithm to reduce the difficulty by a factor of 10, thus accelerating block creation tenfold. Further details on this switch are provided below under "Transitioning strategy".

2. **Re-adjusting the Ghostdag K parameter**:
   - Reducing block time leads to a higher rate of parallel blocks. Consequently, the Ghostdag K parameter, which is a function of $2 \lambda D$ (where $\lambda$ is the block rate and $D$ is the a priori delay bound), must be recalibrated to maintain network security adhering to the Ghostdag formula (see eq. 1 from section 4.2 of the PHANTOM-GHOSTDAG paper [2]).
   - Setting $D=5, \delta=0.01$, the new Ghostdag K is recalculated to be 124 based on the Poisson tail cutoff therein.

3. **Scaling time-based consensus parameters**:
   - Several parameters conceptually defined by time duration but applied via block count must be scaled with the new bps:
     - **Finality Depth ($\phi$)**: Previously defined for a 24-hour duration at 1 bps (86,400 blocks), it will now correspond to a 12-hour duration at 10 bps (432,000 blocks).
     - **Merge Depth Bound ($M$)**: Defined for a 1-hour duration, it will now increase from 3600 blocks at 1 bps to 36,000 blocks at 10 bps.
     - **Pruning Depth**: Calculated as $\phi + 2M + 4KL + 2K + 2$ [3], where:
       - $\phi$: Finality Depth
       - $M$: Merge Depth Bound
       - $L$: Mergeset Size Limit (see below)
       - $K$: Ghostdag K
       - The pruning depth formula provides a lower bound, yet the actual pruning period can be set larger. Plugging in the scaled parameters, the lower bound is calculated to be 627,258 blocks, representing approximately ~17.4238 hours. We suggest rounding this up to 24, 30, or 36 hours for simplicity and practical application.
     - **Coinbase Maturity**: Originally defined as 100 seconds or ~100 blocks at 1 bps, this will now correspond to 1000 blocks at 10 bps.

4. **Conservative scaling of performance-impacting parameters**:
   - **Max Block Parents**: Increased from 10 to 16. Based on continuous TN11 data, 16 remains well above the average number of DAG tips, ensuring that all tips are normally merged by subsequent blocks.
   - **Mergeset Size Limit ($L$)**: Increased from 180 to 248 ($2K$) to accommodate the higher bps while maintaining storage efficiency.

5. **Adjustments to the Coinbase reward mechanism**:
   - The scheme described below keeps the reward system and the emission schedule precisely intact by conceptually transferring the current reward per block to a *reward per second* with equal value.     
   - Specifically, the reward table will continue to map from months to rewards, but the reward is now considered a per-second reward. To calculate the per-block reward, the per-second reward is divided by the bps.
   - Special care must be taken to correctly calculate the current emission month. Previously, the DAA score (essentially a block count) mapped directly to seconds since blocks were produced at a rate of 1 block per second. Post-hardfork, with 10 bps, the DAA score at activation must be used to maintain accurate second counting.
   - Two key values are used in the subsidy month calculation:
     - `deflationary_phase_daa_score`: A constant from the current consensus rules that marks the start of the deflationary phase.
     - `crescendo_activation_daa_score`: The DAA score at the time of the Crescendo activation, which will be set as part of the hardfork's implementation.
   - The following code depicts the required permanent change in subsidy month calculation. The returned `subsidy_month` value can then be used as before to extract the reward from the subsidy-by-month table.

```rust
    // We define a year as 365.25 days and a month as 365.25 / 12 = 30.4375
    // SECONDS_PER_MONTH = 30.4375 * 24 * 60 * 60
    const SECONDS_PER_MONTH: u64 = 2629800;

    fn subsidy_month(daa_score: u64) -> u64 {
        if daa_score < crescendo_activation_daa_score {
            // Pre activation, we simply assume block count represents second units (since block per second = 1)
            return (daa_score - deflationary_phase_daa_score) / SECONDS_PER_MONTH;
        }

        // Else, count seconds differently before and after Crescendo activation
        let seconds_since_deflationary_phase_started = 
            (crescendo_activation_daa_score - deflationary_phase_daa_score) + 
            (daa_score - crescendo_activation_daa_score) / bps;
        return seconds_since_deflationary_phase_started / SECONDS_PER_MONTH;
    }
```

### 2. Activation of earlier KIP proposals

- **Activation of KIP-4: Sparse DAA and Median Time Windows**:
   - Transitioning to sparse Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) and sparse Median Time (MT) windows while maintaining their previous durations (2641 seconds for DAA; 263 seconds for Median Time).
   - The size of these sparse windows (in blocks) is determined by dividing their durations by chosen sampling intervals. For DAA, we choose a sampling interval of 4 seconds, resulting in a window size of $\lceil 2641/4 \rceil = 661$. For MT, we choose a sampling interval of 10 seconds, resulting in $\lceil 263/10 \rceil = 27$. Notably, these window sizes are now independent of bps.
   - Sampling intervals are scaled by bps to calculate *block* sample rates:
     - `past_median_time_sample_rate = 100` (from `MEDIAN_TIME_SAMPLE_INTERVAL=10`).
     - `difficulty_adjustment_sample_rate = 40` (from `DIFFICULTY_WINDOW_SAMPLE_INTERVAL=4`).

- **KIP-9 (Storage Mass)**: Introduces a storage mass formula to mitigate and regulate UTXO set growth in both organic and adversarial conditions.
- **KIP-13 (Transient Storage Mass)**: Implements transient storage mass to regulate short-term storage usage.
- **KIP-10 (Script Engine Enhancements)**: Introduces direct introspection within the script engine, enabling covenants and advanced transaction controls.


### 3. Additional changes
#### Requiring first block parent as Ghostdag selected parent

A new consensus header-validity rule is introduced where the first direct block parent must be the Ghostdag selected parent. This simplifies bringing a witness of the selected chain, particularly for scenarios pre-KIP-6 (which is unplanned for this hardfork).


#### Enabling Transaction Payloads

This hardfork introduces support for arbitrary data in the `payload` field of native (non-coinbase) transactions. Native transactions, which represent the standard transaction type, now support payloads, while coinbase transactions retain their existing restricted format. Transactions already include a reserved byte array field named `payload`, which was previously required to remain empty for native transactions. This restriction is now lifted, enabling native transactions to carry arbitrary data.

To ensure proper handling, the `sighash` mechanism must be adapted to include the `payload` field, proving authorization over the payload. This is achieved by hashing the `payload` into a `payload_hash` and incorporating it into the overall `sighash`. For backwards compatibility, if the `payload` is empty, the zero hash is returned as the `payload_hash`.

The `payload` field is already included in the transaction `hash` and `id` in current Kaspa implementations. However, other clients may have assumed this field is always empty and must verify their implementations to account for it.

This change enables preliminary second-layer smart contract implementations, leveraging Kaspa for sequencing and data availability without settlement functionality yet. Abuse or spam risks are mitigated by the transient storage regulation introduced in KIP-13. This functionality has already been implemented in RK and activated for TN11 ([pull request](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/pull/591)).


## Transitioning strategy
- **Handling Difficulty Adjustment during transition**:
   - A general challenge arises when switching bps, where the DAA window post-activation spans both the 1 bps era and the 10 bps era. Care must be taken to avoid overly decreasing difficulty due to the slower rate at the prefix of the window.
   - Additionally, with the switch to KIP-4, the strategy changes from a full DAA window to a sparse one.
   - **Proposed solution**:
     - Reset the DAA window and start it anew at the activation point. For example, one second after activation, the window will include only the first activated header.
     - To mitigate potential difficulty volatility in the first few seconds, fix the difficulty constant (equal to the activation point difficulty) until the new window accumulates sufficient size.

- **Pruning Point Adjustment**:
   - Upon activation, the pruning depth increases to accommodate the higher bps. However, this does not imply that the pruning point itself should regress to achieve the new depth immediately.
   - The pruning point will remain fixed at its current location until a point above it accumulates sufficient depth under the new parameters. This ensures a smooth transition and avoids unnecessary pruning point instability.

- **Fork Activation Mechanism**: Specify block height or timestamp for activation.
- **Upgrade Timeline**: Define stages for node updates and any compatibility windows.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: Outline how the network will address potential edge cases during the transition.
